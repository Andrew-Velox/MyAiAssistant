## After Deployment

### Update CORS in Flask (app.py):

Once deployed, update your CORS to include your production domain:

```python
CORS(app, resources={
    r"/*": {
        "origins": [
            "http://localhost:3000",  # Local dev
            "https://your-portfolio.vercel.app",  # Your Next.js site
            "https://your-rag-api.railway.app"  # Your API (optional)
        ],
        "methods": ["GET", "POST", "OPTIONS"],
        "allow_headers": ["Content-Type", "Authorization"]
    }
})
```

### Update Next.js Environment Variables:

```bash
# .env.local (local development)
RAG_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

# On Vercel (production)
RAG_API_URL=https://your-api.railway.app
```

---

## Testing Your Deployed API

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-api.railway.app/api/health

# Test query endpoint
curl -X POST https://your-api.railway.app/api/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Who are you?", "top_k": 5}'
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: App crashes on startup
- Check logs in Railway/Render dashboard
- Ensure `GROQ_API_KEY` is set
- Verify all files are pushed to GitHub

### Issue: Module not found
- Check that `requirements.txt` includes all dependencies
- Rebuild the app

### Issue: CORS errors
- Update CORS origins in `app.py`
- Include your Next.js domain
